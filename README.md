This is the second practice problem which is about interaction with the OS and filesystem in python. Here we are going to 

1) create a new directory
2) download some necessary files for calculations
3) process data from those files:Read each file
4) perform some calculations i.e. find out the EMIs based on those loans of each list and 
5) write those EMIs back to the files. 

Here's the links of files required for EMI calculations:
